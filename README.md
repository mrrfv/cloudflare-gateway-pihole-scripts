# Cloudflare Gateway Pi-hole Scripts (CGPS)

![Cloudflare Gateway Analytics screenshot](.github/images/gateway_analytics.png)

Cloudflare Gateway allows you to create custom rules to filter HTTP, DNS, and network traffic based on your firewall policies. This is a collection of scripts that can be used to get a similar experience as if you were using Pi-hole, but with Cloudflare Gateway - so no servers to maintain or need to buy a Raspberry Pi!

## About the individual scripts

- `cf_list_delete.js` - Deletes all lists created by CGPS from Cloudflare Gateway. This is useful for subsequent runs.
- `cf_list_create.js` - Takes an input.csv file containing domains and creates lists in Cloudflare Gateway
- `cf_gateway_rule_create.js` - Creates a Cloudflare Gateway rule to block all traffic if it matches the lists created by CGPS.
- `cf_gateway_rule_delete.js` - Deletes the Cloudflare Gateway rule created by CGPS. Useful for subsequent runs.

## Features

- Support for basic hosts files
- Full support for domain lists
- Automatically cleans up filter lists: removes duplicates, invalid domains, comments and more
- Works fully unattended

## Usage

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js installed on your machine
2. Cloudflare [Zero Trust](https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/) account - the Free plan is enough. Use the Cloudflare [documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/) for details.
3. Cloudflare email, API key (NOT the API token), and account ID
4. A file containing the domains you want to block - **max 300,000 domains for the free plan** - in the working directory named `input.csv`. Oisd provides awesome [DNS block collection](https://oisd.nl/includedlists/big) that work well with this project. A bash script that downloads the oisd big list (https://oisd.nl/), `get_oisd_big_list.sh`, is included.


### Running locally

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the values.
4. If this is a subsequent run, execute `node cf_gateway_rule_delete.js` and `node cf_list_delete.js` (in order) to delete old data.
5. If you're on Linux and haven't downloaded any filters yourself, use the `get_oisd_big_list.sh` script to download recommended oisd big lists (about 280 000 domains).
6. Run `node cf_list_create.js` to create the lists in Cloudflare Gateway. This will take a while.
7. Run `node cf_gateway_rule_create.js` to create the firewall rule in Cloudflare Gateway.
8. Profit!

### Running in GitHub Actions

These scripts can be run using GitHub Actions so your filters will be automatically updated and pushed to Cloudflare Gateway. This is useful if you are using a frequently updated malware blocklist.

1. Create a new empty, private repository. Forking or public repositories are discouraged, but supported - although the script never leaks your API keys and GitHub Actions secrets are automatically redacted from the logs, it's better to be safe than sorry.
2. Create the following GitHub Actions secrets in your repository settings:

- `CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY`: Your Cloudflare API key
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`: Your Cloudflare account ID
- `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare account email
- `CLOUDFLARE_LIST_ITEM_LIMIT`: The maximum number of blocked domains allowed for your Cloudflare Zero Trust plan. Use 300000 for the free plan or if you're unsure.

3. Create a new file in the repository named `.github/workflows/main.yml` with the contents of `auto_update_github_action.yml` found in this repository. The default settings will update your filters every week at 3 AM UTC. You can change this by editing the `schedule` property.
4. Enable GitHub Actions in your repository settings.

### DNS setup for Cloudflare Gateway

1. Go to your Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard, and navigate to Gateway -> DNS Locations.
2. Click on the default location or create one if it doesn't exist.
3. Configure your router or device based on the provided DNS addresses.

Alternatively, you can install the Cloudflare WARP client and log in to Zero Trust. This method proxies your traffic over Cloudflare servers, meaning it works similarly to a commercial VPN.

## Why not...

### Pi-hole or Adguard Home?

- Complex setup to get it working outside your home
- Requires a Raspberry Pi

### NextDNS?

- DNS filtering is disabled after 300,000 queries per month on the free plan

### Cloudflare Gateway?

- Requires a valid credit card
- Limit of 300k domains on the free plan

### a hosts file?

- Potential performance issues, especially on [Windows](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts/issues/93)
- No filter updates
- Doesn't work for your mobile device
- No statistics on how many domains you've blocked
